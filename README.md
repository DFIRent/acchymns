# acchymns.com
A website where all song books are available for access

Made a repository so sourcecode can be easily accessable and update information can be posted for all

# Information

acchymns.com is a website that will have all the song books in multiple languges accessable by all. The goal of the site is to have as many books as possible on there, as well as giving you the option of using it with Dark Mode (dark song pages) or Light Mode (normal pages). This is a personal project, and is being made just for the better good, it is not meant to be taken as a commerical product.

[Supported Books] (possibly out-of-date)
- Zion's Harp
- Gospel Hymns
- Hymns of Zion
- Junior Hymnal
- Zbirka Slavopoja Gospodu Bogu


At the date of writing this, 11/15/2020, I have just started the testing phase of the site. I plan to get every song book that anyone has in any language on the site. At the moment, I am focussing on just getting the books on the site, and having the Dark Mode for the songs come once it is done.

# FAQ

Q: Can I get a book added?
A: Yes, I can add any book you'd like. Either you can give me the book in person, or you can scan the book yourself and send me the images (preferred way).

Q: Can I get *this feature* added?
A: Depends. This is my first project regarding front end web development, so if it is within my abilities and reasonable, I will add it.

Q: Can I use this SRC myself?
A: Sure. If you're going to directly copy some sections of the SRC just add a comment crediting me and I am fine with it. Just don't try and skid the whole site please.

Q: Will there be a downloadable app for Andriod/iOS?
A: In the future, yes. I plan on having apps for both OS's once the website is at a *completely done* state. The plans for the app are to have it downloadable and be able to completely access all the songs whether you have Internet or not (essentially offline).
